Python versions of exercises from the CORE Econ textbook. Find the originals here: https://www.core-econ.org/doing-economics/index.html

An example of the command to convert notebooks to markdown is

```python
poetry run jupyter nbconvert empirical_project_1.ipynb --to markdown --output output.md
```

Make is enabled for this project. To build all markdown documents, use `make`. To clean the `outputs/` folder, it's `make clean`.

## Handover Notes

The links to Jupyter Notebook code for each project will need to be filled in.
