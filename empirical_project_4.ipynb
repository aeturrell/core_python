Each observation would represent the value of an indicator for a particular country and year. This data is organized in ‚Äòlong‚Äô format (each individual‚Äôs information is in multiple rows). This is also called 'tidy' data and it can be recognised by having variable per column and one observation per row. Many data scientists consider keeping data in tidy format good practice.\n",

    "To change data from wide to long format, we use the `pd.melt` method. The `melt` method is very powerful and useful, as you will find many large datasets are in wide format. In this case, `pd.melt` takes the data from all columns not specified as being `id_vars` (via a list of column names), and uses them to create two new columns: one contains the name of the row variable created from the former column names, which is the year here; we can set that new column's name with `var_name=\"year\"`. The second new column contains the values that were in the columns we unpivoted and is automatically given the name `value`. (We could have set a new name for this column by passing `value_name=` too.)\n",

A dictionary is a built-in object type in Python and always has the structure `{key1: value1, key2: value2, ...}` where the keys and values could have any type (eg string, int, dataframe). In our case, both keys and values will be strings. We will use a convention for our naming that is known as \"snake case\".
