    "The `ttest` function automatically assumes that both variables were generated by different groups of people. When calculating the p-value, it assumes that the observed differences are partly due to some variation in characteristics between these two groups, and not just the differences in experimental conditions. However, in this case, the same groups of people did both experiments, so there will not be any variation in characteristics between the groups. When calculating the p-value, we account for this fact with the `paired=True` option."
